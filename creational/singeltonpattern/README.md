# ðŸ”’ Singleton Design Pattern in Object-Oriented Programming

The **Singleton Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** that ensures a class has **only one instance**  
and provides a **global point of access** to that instance.

It is often used when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

In some scenarios, having multiple instances of a class can lead to inconsistent behavior or resource conflicts.  
Examples include configuration managers, logging systems, or database connections.

The **Singleton Pattern** provides a controlled way to ensure only **one instance** of a class exists throughout the application lifecycle.

## ðŸ§  Advantages

**Single Instance Guarantee** â€“ Only one instance of the class exists.  
**Global Access Point** â€“ Provides easy access to the shared instance.  
**Lazy Initialization** â€“ The instance can be created only when needed.  
**Controlled Resource Management** â€“ Useful for managing shared resources like database connections or caches.  
**Thread Safety (if implemented properly)** â€“ Ensures safe access in multithreaded environments.  
**Improved Performance** â€“ Avoids unnecessary object creation.
