# 🏗️ Builder Design Pattern 

The **Builder Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** that allows you to construct complex objects **step by step**.  
It separates the construction of an object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

---

## 📘 Overview

In many cases, an object may require a large number of parameters for initialization — some of which are optional.  
Using long constructors or telescoping constructors (constructors with many parameters) can make the code hard to read and maintain.

The **Builder Pattern** solves this problem by providing a **flexible and readable way** to create objects, especially when dealing with complex configurations.

## 🧠 Advantages

**Improves Readability** – Code is easier to understand and maintain.  
**Avoids Telescoping Constructors** – No need for long constructors with many parameters.  
**Flexibility** – You can create different object configurations easily.  
**Immutable Objects** – Once built, the object can be made immutable.  
**Separation of Concerns** – The construction process is separated from the representation.  
**Reusability** – Builders can be reused for different object configurations.  
**Better Code Organization** – Encapsulates complex construction logic within the builder class.
